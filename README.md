### Summary

This application allows users to search a third-party API (IGDB) for various games and add them to their profile. Users have the ability to create various folders for their games, and check games off when completed. A user's profile page displays the number of games that have been completed, as well as total number of games added. Users are able to create their own accounts, and create an infinite amount of folders for their games. 

### Motivation

This application was built with the motivation to allow users to keep track of video games they desire to play in the future. This application hopes to allow individuals that play video games the ability to more-easily search through a large database of games and save them in one place. Additionally, users will be able to see games they have completed in the past in hopes of sparking memories and creating a "trophy list" of sorts.
